# Pairs Trading Strategy using Statistical Arbitrage

##  Project Overview
This project implements a **Pairs Trading** strategy â€” a market-neutral approach that profits from relative price movements between two cointegrated stocks. It uses statistical tests to identify suitable pairs and applies a mean-reversion trading logic to generate buy/sell signals.

> Inspired by quantitative finance principles, this strategy focuses on **cointegration** over mere correlation to ensure robustness.
